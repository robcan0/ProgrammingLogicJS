### Challenge I: Hero Level Classifier

#### Objective
Create variables to store the hero's **name** and **experience points (XP)**. Then, use a decision structure to display the message "The Hero named **{name}** is at level **{level}**", where the level is determined by the XP, according to the table below.

| Level | XP |
| :--- | :--- |
| Iron | Less than 1,000 |
| Bronze | Between 1,001 and 2,000 |
| Silver | Between 2,001 and 5,000 |
| Gold | Between 5,001 and 7,000 |
| Platinum | Between 7,001 and 8,000 |
| Ascendant | Between 8,001 and 9,000 |
| Immortal | Between 9,001 and 10,000 |
| Radiant | Greater than or equal to 10,001 |

### Challenge II: Ranked Match Calculator

#### Objective
Create a function that receives the number of **wins** and **losses** of a player. The ranked match balance is the difference between wins and losses. Based on this balance, the player will be assigned a level, according to the table below. Finally, display the message: "The Hero has a balance of **{balanceOfVictories}** and is at level **{level}**".

| Level | Balance of Victories |
| :--- | :--- |
| Iron | Less than 10 |
| Bronze | Between 11 and 20 |
| Silver | Between 21 and 50 |
| Gold | Between 51 and 80 |
| Diamond | Between 81 and 90 |
| Legendary | Between 91 and 100 |
| Immortal | Greater than or equal to 101 |

#### Required Concepts
* Variables
* Operators
* Loops
* Decision Structures

### Challenge III: Writing the Classes of a Game

#### Objective
Create a generic class to represent an adventure hero. The class should have the properties **`name`**, **`age`**, and **`type`** (e.g., warrior, mage, monk, ninja).

The class must also contain a method called **`attack`** that displays the message "The **{type}** attacked using **{attack}**". The value of **`{attack}`** should vary according to the hero's type, following the table below.

| Type | Attack |
| :--- | :--- |
| Mage | used magic |
| Warrior | used a sword |
| Monk | used martial arts |
| Ninja | used a shuriken |

**Example Output:**
* The mage attacked using magic
* The warrior attacked using a sword
