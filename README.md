## Challenge I: Hero Level Classifier

### Objective
Create variables to store the heroâ€™s name and experience points (XP).  
Then, use a decision structure to display one of the following messages:

- If XP is less than 1,000 = Iron
- If XP is between 1,001 and 2,000 = Bronze
- If XP is between 2,001 and 5,000 = Silver
- If XP is between 5,001 and 7,000 = Gold
- If XP is between 7,001 and 8,000 = Platinum
- If XP is between 8,001 and 9,000 = Ascendant
- If XP is between 9,001 and 10,000 = Immortal
- If XP is greater than or equal to 10,001 = Radiant

#### Output
At the end, a message should be displayed:
"The Hero named **{name}** is at level **{level}**."

#### Required Concepts
- Variables
- Operators
- Decision Structures  

## Challenge II: Ranked Match Calculator  

### Objective:

Create a function that receives the number of player wins and losses as a parameter.
Then assign the result to a variable. The Ranked Match balance is calculated by subtracting the losses from the wins.

- If wins are less than 10 = Iron  
- If wins are between 11 and 20 = Bronze  
- If wins are between 21 and 50 = Silver  
- If wins are between 51 and 80 = Gold  
- If wins are between 81 and 90 = Diamond  
- If wins are between 91 and 100 = Legendary  
- If wins are greater than or equal to 101 = Immortal

#### Output

At the end, a message should be displayed:
"The Hero has a balance of **{balanceOfVictories}** and is at level of **{level}**"
